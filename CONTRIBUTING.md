# Contributing

First of all thanks for reading this, you don't need to be a developer to contribute to this project. I am looking
for a range of skillsets to contribute and input ideas. Including writing up documentation, testing, development and 
 forwarding any ideas you have for the project, any help at all would be greatly appreciated. 

**Database**

If you've got sample data, databases you want me to work with i'd happily include it with the sample data.

**Development**

Currently working through the backlog, any ideas submitted will be added to the Dev board (link). Unassigned tasks in the backlog are free to pick up.

### Styling
I've been trying to follow PEP 8 Style guide [Link](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
Ideally I would want you to do the same.

### Raising an issue
- **Check whether the bug was already reported** Check issues [link](https://github.com/Jonopoly/AnonyPy/issues)
- If the issue has already been raised please contribute any missing information you feel would be useful.
- If you are unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Include as much information as you can

### How to contribute
- Branch from the master branch and if needed rebase the current master branch before submitting your pull request so it can merge cleanly (_without conflict_).
```shell script
git checkout -b my_custom_branch master
```
- Try to keep commits as small as possible
- Once you're happy with your change make a pull request for review. (_Following the steps at: [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)_)
