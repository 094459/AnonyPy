### Styling
I've been trying to follow PEP 8 Style guide [Link](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
Ideally I would want you to do the same.

### Raising an issue
- **Check whether the bug was already reported** Check issues [link](https://github.com/Jonopoly/AnonyPy/issues)
- If you you find somebody else is having a similar issue feel free to contribute and useful information
- If you are unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Include as much information as you can

### How to contribute
- Branch from the master branch and if needed rebase the current master branch before submitting your pull request so it can merge cleanly (_without conflict_).
```shell script
git checkout -b my_custom_branch master
```
- Try to keep commits small as possible
- Once you're happy with your change make a pull request. (_Following the steps at: [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)_)
